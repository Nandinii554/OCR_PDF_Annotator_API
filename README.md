# OCR PDF Annotator with FastAPI, Tesseract, and PyMuPDF

This project is a containerized web service built using **FastAPI** that performs **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** on PDF documents. It uses **Tesseract OCR** to extract text and **PyMuPDF** to draw bounding boxes around recognized text directly on the original PDF.

OCR has become a critical tool in document digitization, automation, and data extraction. However, raw OCR text often lacks visual context, which makes validation and auditing harder. This project provides a solution to:

- Visually **verify OCR accuracy** with bounding boxes
- Retain **PDF structure and layout**
- Make extracted data usable via **structured JSON**

---

## What This App Does

- Accepts PDF files via a web API
- Converts each PDF page into a high-resolution image
- Runs Tesseract OCR on each page image
- Extracts:
  - text
  - bounding box coordinates
  - confidence score
- Maps image coordinates to original PDF coordinates (scaling)
- Draws bounding boxes on the original PDF using PyMuPDF
- Returns:
  - Annotated PDF with visual text markers
  - OCR results as structured JSON

---

- **Frontend**: Swagger UI via FastAPI
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Tesseract OCR + PyMuPDF
- **Storage**: Temporary file system for generated annotated PDFs

## üîÑ OCR Workflow (Internals)

1. **PDF Upload**: The user uploads a `.pdf` file via the `/extract` endpoint.
2. **Image Conversion**: Each page is rasterized at 300 DPI using `pdf2image`, creating pixel-perfect images.
3. **Text Detection**: `pytesseract` runs OCR on each image and returns:
   - Recognized text
   - Bounding box: `(left, top, width, height)`
   - Confidence score
4. **Coordinate Scaling**: Image-based coordinates are scaled to match the PDF's point system (1 point = 1/72 inch).
5. **Annotation**: Rectangles are drawn over the text regions using PyMuPDF‚Äôs `draw_rect()` function.
6. **Output**:
   - The annotated PDF is saved temporarily
   - A JSON response includes a download link and structured text
